# 2048

This is basically a simple re-creation of the game 2048.
Ever since I started playing this game, I get super addicted to it, and I ended up deciding recreating the game myself!

Right now it is still in progress: 
    
    There are still some game mechanics bugs to be fixed, but the game is playable. 
    The color and design of the game will be changed soon, hopefully into a prettier version of 2048. 
    (I might add pictures of Pepe just because I love him).

There is not much here yet, but thanks for visiting this page! :)
