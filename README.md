# Re-Designing 2048

A simple re-creation of the game 2048.

Motivation:

    Recently, I came across the usage of Processing in designing drawings, animations, and interactive programs. Therefore, I decided to utilize its functionality to re-design one of my favourite games 2048.

Progress: 
    
    There are still some game mechanics bugs to be fixed, but the game is playable. 
    The color and design of the game will be changed soon, hopefully into a prettier version of 2048. 
    (I might add pictures of Pepe just because I love him).

There is not much here yet, but thanks for visiting this page! :)
