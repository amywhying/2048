# Re-Designing 2048

A simple re-creation of the game 2048.

Motivation:

    Recently, I came across the usage of Processing in designing drawings, animations, and interactive programs. 
    So, I decided to learn more about it and utilize its functionality to re-design one of my favourite games, 2048.

Progress: 
    
    There are still some minor bugs to be fixed, but the game is playable. 
    The color and design of the game will be changed soon, with the plan of
    replacing numbers with different Pepe gifs.
    More functionality: Best score so far, undo-option, delete-a-tile-option (granted from 512,1024,2048...), delete-a-row/column-option (granted from 512,1024,2048...)
    Another upcoming functionality would be to allow users to input their pictures or gifs in order to customize their game.

There is not much here yet, but thanks for visiting this page! :)
